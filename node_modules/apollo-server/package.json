It works with pretty much all Node.js HTTP server frameworks, and we're happy to take PRs for more! Apollo Server works with any GraphQL schema built with [GraphQL.js](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js), so you can build your schema with that directly or with a convenience library such as [graphql-tools](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphql-tools/).\n\n## Principles\n\nApollo Server is built with the following principles in mind:\n\n- **By the community, for the community**: Apollo Server's development is driven by the needs of developers.\n- **Simplicity**: By keeping things simple, Apollo Server is easier to use, easier to contribute to, and more secure.\n- **Performance**: Apollo Server is well-tested and production-ready.\n\nAnyone is welcome to contribute to Apollo Server, just read [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md), take a look at the [roadmap](./ROADMAP.md) and make your first PR!\n\n## Getting started\n\nApollo Server is super easy to set up. Just `npm install apollo-server-<integration>`, write a GraphQL schema, and then use one of the following snippets to get started. For more info, read the [Apollo Server docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/v2).\n\nThere are two installation patterns:\n\n* **[Standalone](#Installation-standalone)**: To get started without integrating with an existing web framework, use the `apollo-server` package.\n* **[Integrations](#Installation-integrations)**: For applications which have already use a web framework (e.g. `express`, `koa`, `hapi`, etc.), use the appropriate Apollo Server integration package.\n\n### Installation: Standalone\n\nIn a new project, install the `apollo-server` and `graphql` dependencies using:\n\n    npm install apollo-server graphql\n\nThen, create an `index.js` which defines the schema and its functionality (i.e. resolvers):\n\n```js\nconst { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server');\n\n// The GraphQL schema\nconst typeDefs = gql`\n  type Query {\n    \"A simple type for getting started!\"\n    hello: String\n  }\n`;\n\n// A map of functions which return data for the schema.\nconst resolvers = {\n  Query: {\n    hello: () => 'world',\n  },\n};\n\nconst server = new ApolloServer({\n  typeDefs,\n  resolvers,\n});\n\nserver.listen().then(({ url }) => {\n  console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at ${url}`);\n});\n```\n\n> Due to its human-readability, we recommend using [schema-definition language (SDL)](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/essentials/schema.html#sdl) to define a GraphQL schema but [a `GraphQLSchema` object from `graphql-js`](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/#using-graphqljs) can also be specified in place of `typeDefs` and `resolvers` using the `schema` property:\n>\n> ```js\n> const server = new ApolloServer({\n>   schema: ...\n> });\n> ```\n\nFinally, start the server using `node index.js` and open your web-browser to the URL which is output on the console.\n\nFor more details, check out the Apollo Server [Getting Started guide](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/getting-started.html) of the documentation, or for a more comprehensive understanding, see the [fullstack tutorial](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/introduction.html).\n\nFor questions, the [Apollo commuinty on Spectrum.chat](https://spectrum.chat) is a great place to get assistance.\n\n## Installation: Integrations\n\nWhile the standalone installation above can be used without making a decision about which web framework to use, the Apollo Server integration packages are paired with specific web frameworks (e.g. Express, Koa, hapi).\n\nThe following web frameworks have Apollo Server integrations, and each of these linked integrations has its own installation instructions and examples on its package `README.md`:\n\n- [Express](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/tree/master/packages/apollo-server-express) _(Most popular)_\n- [Koa](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/tree/master/packages/apollo-server-koa)\n- [Hapi](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/tree/master/packages/apollo-server-hapi)\n- [Fastify](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/tree/master/packages/apollo-server-fastify)\n- [Amazon Lambda](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/tree/master/packages/apollo-server-lambda)\n- [Micro](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/tree/master/packages/apollo-server-micro)\n- [Azure Functions](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/tree/master/packages/apollo-server-azure-functions)\n- [Google Cloud Functions](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/tree/master/packages/apollo-server-cloud-functions)\n- [Cloudflare](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/tree/master/packages/apollo-server-cloudflare) _(Experimental)_\n\nSee the links above for more details on a specific integration.\n\n## Context\n\nA request context is available for each request.  When `context` is defined as a function, it will be called on each request and receive an object containing a `req` property which represents the request.\n\nBy returning an object from the `context` function, it will be available as the third positional paramter of the resolvers:\n\n```js\nnew ApolloServer({\n  typeDefs,\n  resolvers: {\n    Query: {\n      books: (parent, args, context, info) => {\n        console.log(context.myProperty); // Will be `true`!\n        return books;\n      },\n    }\n  },\n  context: async ({ req }) => {\n    return {\n      myProperty: true\n    };\n  },\n})\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe [Apollo Server documentation](https://apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) contains many of the details which are necessary to get started with both GraphQL and Apollo Server.\n\nThe raw source content of that documentation is available within the `docs/` directory of this monorepo, but the _Edit on GitHub_ buttons at the bottom of each page can be used to contribute suggestions or improvements to the published content.\n\n## Development\n\nIf you want to develop or contribute to Apollo Server itself, we suggest the following:\n\n- Fork this repository\n\n- Install the Apollo Server project in your computer\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/[your-user]/apollo-server\ncd apollo-server\nnpm install\ncd packages/apollo-server-<integration>/\nnpm link\n```\n\n- Install your local Apollo Server in other App\n\n```\ncd ~/myApp\nnpm link apollo-server-<integration>\n```\n\nFor more help with contributing, visit the _Contributing_ channel on the [Apollo community in Spectrum.chat](https://spectrum.chat/apollo).\n\n## Maintainers\n\n- [@martijnwalraven](https://github.com/martijnwalraven) (Apollo)\n- [@abernix](https://github.com/abernix) (Apollo)\n",
